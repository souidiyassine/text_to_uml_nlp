The factory produces several lines of furniture, each with a different name and consisting of several pieces of furniture of different types (beds, tables, chairs, …). All furniture pieces have a type, a single reference (eg CC6578) and a selling price. The major competitive advantage of this innovative plant is the fact that each component produced can be used in more than one piece of furniture. Each piece of furniture is thus composed of several components. The same component can be used more than once in the same piece. Every type of component produced is assigned a unique numerical code, a manufacturing price and a type (screw, hinge, shelf …). The furniture is then sold in various stores throughout the world. Each store has a different address and a fax number. To make the manufacturing process more efficient, stores have to place orders everytime they need to replenish their stock. These orders must also be stored in the database. Each order has a order number, a date, the store that placed the order as well as a list of all the ordered furniture and their quantities.
