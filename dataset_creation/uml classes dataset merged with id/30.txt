Each college has a website
Each college is structured into departments, each of which brings together specific teachers. Among these teachers, one of them is responsible for the department.
A teacher is defined by his surname, first name, phone, email, date of taking office and his index.
Each teacher teaches only one subject.
Students take several subjects and receive a mark for each of them.
For each student, we want to manage his name, first name, phone, email, as well as his year of entry to college.
A subject can be taught by several teachers but always takes place in the same classroom (each having a specific number of places).
We want to be able to calculate the average by subject as well as by department
We also want to calculate the general average of a student and be able to display the subjects in which he has not been noted
Finally, we must be able to print the data sheet (, first name, phone, email) of a teacher or a student.
