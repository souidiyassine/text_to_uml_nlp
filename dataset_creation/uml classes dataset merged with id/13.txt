Each college has its own website. Each college is structured into departments, each of which has specific teachers. Among these teachers, one of them is responsible for the department. A teacher is defined by his name, first name, phone number, e-mail, date of employment and his index. Each teacher teaches only one subject. The students take several subjects and receive a grade for each of them. For each student, we want to manage his name, first name, phone number, e-mail, as well as his year of entry to the college. A subject can be taught by several teachers but always in the same classroom (each one having a certain number of seats). We want to be able to calculate the average per subject and per department. We also want to calculate a student's overall average and display the subjects in which he or she was not graded. Finally, we want to be able to print the data sheet (, first name, phone, e-mail) of a teacher or a student.
