You are asked to create a database allowing you to store cooking recipes and also manage the stocks of ingredients you have. Each cooking recipe has a name, a description, the preparation and cooking time, the number of calories per person, the number of portions and the level of difficulty: difficult, medium or easy. For each recipe you want to know what ingredients are needed and the amount associated with each ingredient. For each ingredient you have its name and the number of calories per 100 grams of this ingredient. Each ingredient has a type, for example starch for the ingredient potato. The same ingredient can have several packaging, for example, the flour ingredient can be stored in the form of a 1 kg or 500 g package. These two packagings will be considered as different products. To manage the stocks of the ingredients, the place of storage of the products in the housing is memorized. Each storage is named and for each storage you know which products are stored there. The same ingredient can be stored in several compartments.
