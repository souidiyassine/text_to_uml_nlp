For each admitted animal, its name, breed (if any) and owner must be stored. Each animal should be given an unique numeric identifier. For each owner, its name, address and phone number should be stored. An unique numeric identifier should also be generated for each one of them. An animal might be owner-less. This happens frequently as the clinic often rescues abandoned dogs from the streets in order to treat them and get them new owners. It should be possible to store information about a specific breed even if no animals of that breed have been treated at the clinic. Each appointement always has a responsible physician. All appointements start at a certain date and time; and are attended by an animal (and of course its owner). For each physician, his name, address and phone number should be stored. An unique numeric identifier should also be generated for each one of them. In an appointement, several medical conditions might be detected. Each condition has a common name and a scientific name. No two conditions have the same scientific name. It should be possible to store information about the most common conditions for each different breed in the database.
