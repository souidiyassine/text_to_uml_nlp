We want to model a system for management of flights and pilots.
An airline operates flights. Each airline has an ID.
Each flight has an ID a departure airport and an arrival airport: an 
airport as a unique identifier.
Each flight has a pilot and a co-pilot, and it uses an aircraft of a 
certain type; a flight has also a departure time and an arrival time. 
An airline owns a set of aircrafts of different types. 
An aircraft can be in a working state or it can be under repair. 
In a particular moment an aircraft can be landed or airborne. 
A company has a set of pilots: each pilot has an experience level:
1 is minimum, 3 is maximum.
A type of aeroplane may need a particular number of pilots, with a 
different role (e.g.: captain, co-pilot, navigator): there must be at least 
one captain and one co-pilot, and a captain must have a level 3.
