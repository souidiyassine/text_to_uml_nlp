An employee takes care of registering the loans of members who want to borrow the CD-ROMs. The employee must first authenticate to perform this operation. Each cd borrowed must be returned to the library employee after a period of 3 days. The member can therefore reserve CD-ROMs containing games, each reservation must mention the borrower, the game and the date of reservation. The member is notified when the game (cd) returns to the shelves.
The employee can also organize events, to do so he must provide the following information: the minimum and maximum number of participants, the games to be tested, the date of the event and the start time of the event.
The member who wishes to participate in an event can register provided that there is still space available. To do so, he must enter a password and login.
If the member finds an available place then he can pay his subscription online by an external payment system.
