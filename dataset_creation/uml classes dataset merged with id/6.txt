We want to automate the management of a small municipal library. For this, we analyzed its operation to obtain the following list of rules and statements:
Members have a first name (character string) and a surname (character string).
The library consists of a set of documents and a set of patrons.
Members are subscribed or unsubscribed on a simple request.
New documents are added to the library regularly.
These documents are either journals or volumes.
Volumes are either dictionaries, books or comics.
The documents are characterized by a title (character string).
Volumes also have an author (character string). Bds also have a recipient name (character string).
The newspapers have, in addition to the characteristics of the documents, a date of publication (a date).
Only books can be borrowed.
A member can borrow or return a book.
Members can borrow books (and only books) and it must be possible to know at any time which books a member has borrowed.
A member can borrow a maximum of 3 books.
The return date for a borrowed book is fixed at the time of the loan. This date can be extended upon request.
