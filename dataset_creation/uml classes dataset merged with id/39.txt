A hotel is composed of at least two rooms. Each room has a bathroom: shower or bath. A hotel accommodates people. It can employ staff and it must be managed by a manager. Only the first and last names of the employees, managers and occupants are known. Some people are children and others are adults (it is forbidden to employ children). A hotel has the following characteristics: an address, a number of rooms and a category. A room is characterized by the number and beds it contains, its price and its number. We want to know who occupies which room on which date. For each day of the year, we want to be able to calculate the rent of each room according to its price and its occupation (the rent is null if the room is unoccupied). The sum of these rents allows to calculate the turnover of the hotel between two dates.
