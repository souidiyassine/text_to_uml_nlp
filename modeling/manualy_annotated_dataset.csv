"Each college has a website
Each college is structured into departments, each of which brings together specific teachers. Among these teachers, one of them is responsible for the department.
A teacher is defined by his surname, first name, phone, email, date of taking office and his index.
Each teacher teaches only one subject.
Students take several subjects and receive a mark for each of them.
For each student, we want to manage his name, first name, phone, email, as well as his year of entry to college.
A subject can be taught by several teachers but always takes place in the same classroom (each having a specific number of places).
We want to be able to calculate the average by subject as well as by department
We also want to calculate the general average of a student and be able to display the subjects in which he has not been noted
Finally, we must be able to print the data sheet (, first name, phone, email) of a teacher or a student.",DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN SPACE DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON ADP PRON VERB ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NUM ADP PRON AUX ADJ ADP DET NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP VERB NOUN CCONJ PRON NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN VERB ADV NUM NOUN PUNCT SPACE NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON ADP PRON PUNCT SPACE ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB PART VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADV ADV ADP PRON NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN AUX AUX VERB ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SPACE PRON VERB PART AUX ADJ PART VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADV ADV ADP ADP NOUN SPACE PRON ADV VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ AUX ADJ PART VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON PRON AUX PART AUX VERB SPACE ADV PUNCT PRON AUX AUX ADJ PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT,O entity relationship O attr O O entity O relationship O entity O O O O relationship O O entity O O O entity O O O O O relationship O O entity O O O entity O relationship O O attr O O attr O attr O attr O attr O O O O O attr O O O entity relationship O O entity O O entity relationship O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O attr O O attr O attr O attr O O O O O attr O O O entity O O O entity O O relationship O O entity O O O O O O O entity O O O O O attr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O entity O O O relationship O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O attr O attr O attr O O O entity O O entity O

"The factory produces several lines of furniture, each with a different name and consisting of several pieces of furniture of different types (beds, tables, chairs, …). All furniture pieces have a type, a single reference (eg CC6578) and a selling price. The major competitive advantage of this innovative plant is the fact that each component produced can be used in more than one piece of furniture. Each piece of furniture is thus composed of several components. The same component can be used more than once in the same piece. Every type of component produced is assigned a unique numerical code, a manufacturing price and a type (screw, hinge, shelf …). The furniture is then sold in various stores throughout the world. Each store has a different address and a fax number. To make the manufacturing process more efficient, stores have to place orders everytime they need to replenish their stock. These orders must also be stored in the database. Each order has a order number, a date, the store that placed the order as well as a list of all the ordered furniture and their quantities.",DET NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN AUX DET NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN VERB AUX AUX VERB ADP ADJ ADP NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET ADJ NOUN AUX AUX VERB ADJ ADP ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB AUX VERB DET ADJ PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADV ADJ PUNCT NOUN VERB PART VERB NOUN NOUN PRON VERB PART VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX ADV AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN ADV ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP DET DET VERB NOUN CCONJ PRON NOUN PUNCT,O O O O entity O O O O O O O attr O relationship O O entity O O O O attr O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O attr O O O attr O O O O O O O attr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O entity O O O O entity O O O O relationship O O entity O O O entity O O O O O O O O O entity O O attr O entity O O O O O O attr O O O attr O O attr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O entity O O O attr O O attr attr O O O O O O O O O entity O O relationship entity O O O O O O O O O entity O O O relationship O O entity O O entity O O entity attr O O attr O O entity O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Consider a company with six factories that builds engine components. A single factory takes care of the assembly,
Customers place orders, priority customer places orders first with 20% more of the order. Orders are received by the sales department. If the customer places more than ten orders then he has priority. After processing the orders received, the sales department obtains a breakdown of the parts: manufactured parts and subcontracted parts.
The sales department can print two types of listings: home listing sent to the factory, and a listing of the subtracted components sent to the stock management department which takes care of the supply of raw materials.

"Or a media library for the borrowing of works by registered customers using a registration form containing their information (name, address, etc.). We have three types of customers, a customer at reduced rates, a customer who subscribes for a year or a customer at a normal rate. All loans have a fixed duration which does not exceed 10 days.
A customer can borrow different types of work: audio, video or books. These works are recorded in the media library by a unique code. On the other hand, there are documents that the customer cannot borrow, but can only be consulted on site.
Each book has a particular type, for example the books have a ""novel"" type, or are of the ""detective"" type, etc.
After borrowing a book, the librarian creates a borrowing sheet. This sheet must contain the name of the customer, the date of loan and the date of return. The librarian can add or delete a client or a work.
The borrowing of a document by a client follows certain rules:
The maximum number of documents to borrow is 5, if it exceeds this number then any new borrowing will be impossible.
If the customer who has borrowed a document and who has not returned it, his return deadline will be blocked from making any new loan until he has returned the work, even if the maximum number of borrowing is not reached.",CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP VERB NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN VERB PRON NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT X PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET VERB NOUN PRON AUX PART VERB NUM NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN AUX VERB ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT PRON VERB NOUN PRON DET NOUN AUX PART VERB PUNCT CCONJ AUX ADV AUX VERB ADP NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN DET NOUN VERB DET PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT CCONJ AUX ADP DET PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT X X SPACE ADP VERB DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB CCONJ VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PART VERB AUX NUM PUNCT SCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN ADV DET ADJ NOUN AUX AUX ADJ PUNCT SPACE SCONJ DET NOUN PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN CCONJ PRON AUX PART VERB PRON PUNCT PRON NOUN NOUN AUX AUX VERB ADP VERB DET ADJ NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN PUNCT ADV SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN AUX PART VERB PUNCT,O O O entity O O relationship O entity O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O entity O O O O O entity O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O relationship O O O entity O entity O entity O entity O O entity O relationship O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O relationship O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O attr O O O O entity O O O O O attr O O O O O O O O attr O O O O O relationship O entity O O O O O relationship O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O relationship O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O relationship O O O O O O O O O O O relationship O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O relationship O O O O

"Each customer has a VAT number, a name, a phone number and an address. There are no two clients with the same VAT number. When a customer wants to send a package to another customer, he just has to login to the company website, select the customer he wants to send the package to, enter the package’s weight and if the delivery is normal or urgent. He then receives an unique identifier code that he writes on the package. The package is then delivered by the customer at the delivery center of his choosing. A delivery center has a unique name and an address. Each client has an associated delivery center. This delivery center is chosen by the company and it is normally the one closest to the customer’s house. The package is them routed through an internal system until it reaches the delivery center of the recipient.

"Anyone who has carried out a professional activity for 5 years related to the subject of their application may apply for a technological and vocational education diploma from the Center for Validation of Acquired Skills of the Academy of their place of residence. .

The employee obtains a blank file from the Academy's Acquired Validation Center (CAVA). After completing the file, the employee sends it to the CAVA. The file contains the civil status of the candidate (surname, first name, address), a description of his professional activities for 5 years, the diploma requested. The files are registered in the CAVA database (a reference number is automatically assigned to them).

The CAVA sends the file to the home of the Academy inspector responsible for the diploma concerned. The inspector verifies whether the file is admissible. That is to say, if the diploma requested corresponds to the professional activities of the candidate for at least 5 years. The inspector communicates his decision to the CAVA, which records it in its database. If the file is admissible, an acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the candidate; otherwise the file is returned to the candidate with a letter indicating the reasons for the refusal of the file.

There is one jury per diploma. A jury is made up of the Academy inspector responsible for the diploma and teachers. The CAVA knows the contact details of the teachers who are members of a jury. Each jury meets three times a year.

The schedule of jury meetings is established by the Academy inspector responsible for the diploma concerned, at the start of the school year. Three weeks before a meeting of a jury, the CAVA summons the members of the jury as well as the candidates with a pending diploma application file (concerning the diploma under the responsibility of the jury).

At the end of a meeting, the jury draws up minutes in which the decisions of the jury are summarized (acceptance or refusal of the diploma). Depending on this report, the CAVA sends a certificate of diploma to the candidates or a refusal of diploma.",PRON PRON AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NUM NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET PROPN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN ADP DET PROPN ADP PRON NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN PART PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT PUNCT ADP VERB DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB PRON ADP DET PROPN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PUNCT DET NOUN ADP PRON ADJ NOUN ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET PROPN NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN AUX ADV VERB ADP PRON PUNCT PUNCT SPACE DET PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADJ ADP DET NOUN VERB PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN SCONJ DET NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT PRON AUX PART VERB PUNCT SCONJ DET NOUN VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADV ADV NUM NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB PRON NOUN ADP DET PROPN PUNCT PRON VERB PRON ADP PRON NOUN PUNCT SCONJ DET NOUN AUX ADJ PUNCT DET NOUN ADP NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT ADV DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT SPACE PRON VERB NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN AUX VERB ADP ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADJ ADP DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON AUX NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB NUM NOUN DET NOUN PUNCT SPACE DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN AUX VERB ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADJ ADP DET NOUN VERB PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT NUM NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADV ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP DET VERB NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT SPACE ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADP NOUN ADP PRON DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN AUX VERB PUNCT NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O attr O O O O attr O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O entity O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O entity O O entity O O O O O O entity O O O entity O entity O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O entity O O entity O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O entity O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O entity O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O entity O O O O O O O entity O
